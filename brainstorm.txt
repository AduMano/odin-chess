Chess, I have no idea how to play this game xD, I see people play this
and kinda have an idea how pieces move but there are rules that I dont know
that I have to learn before making this. 

First flow is setting up the Board:
  the Board will be on 8x8 grid, each cells is empty when the board is built.
  after building, the board has this code or coordinates where pieces will be placed
    A-H is from left the right (Horizontal)
    8-1 is from top to bottom (Vertical)

    | A8 | B8 | C8 | D8 | E8 | F8 | G8 | H8 |
    | A7 | B7 | C7 | D7 | E7 | F7 | G7 | H7 |
    | A6 | B6 | C6 | D6 | E6 | F6 | G6 | H6 |
    | A5 | B5 | C5 | D5 | E5 | F5 | G5 | H5 |
    | A4 | B4 | C4 | D4 | E4 | F4 | G4 | H4 |
    | A3 | B3 | C3 | D3 | E3 | F3 | G3 | H3 |
    | A2 | B2 | C2 | D2 | E2 | F2 | G2 | H2 |
    | A1 | B1 | C1 | D1 | E1 | F1 | G1 | H1 |

  set the board to translate these coordinates to 2d array to access cells by splitting
    the coordinates into separate character for example, "C5" will be "C" and "5". so we have
    "C" and "5", the "5" is the Y axis, so thats the first we need to translate before we access the X axis
    "C". 5 is the 3rd index or [3] then C is horizontal which is the 2nd index or [2].

  place piece will be a method to place a piece in the board, so thats why we have a translator for the coordinates
  ill be using a hash to translate those coordinates to get the cell to place a piece in a 2d array.

  build board, using the place piece method, i can place pieces to prepare the board.

  render board, its just a combinations of |, + and = to make a grid display.

  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  | R | H | B | Q | K | B | H | R |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  | P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  | P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+
  | R | H | B | Q | K | B | H | R |
  +===+===+===+===+===+===+===+===+

  thats all for the board

Second is the Pieces:
  Well.. Piece is a superclass, but... its just a category?
  Should i implement it as Super and Sub classes or make separate class per piece?

  Implementing a superclass must contain common attributes and methods. So... what are common things
  in pieces? all of them can move, but thats already given and not that necesarry to emphasize.
  each piece is unique so... separated class it is?

    King - Moves one square in any direction.
    Queen - Moves any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.
    Rook - Moves any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
    Bishop - Moves any number of squares diagonally.
    Knight - Moves in an ‘L-shape,’ two squares in a straight direction, and then one square perpendicular to that (Knight can jump on opponents piece).
    Pawn - Moves one square forward, but on its first move, it can move two squares forward. It captures diagonally one square forward.

  These pieces will have their own attributes and behavior like how they move, their location, generate possible legal moves,
  and their rules

  Thats all for the Pieces

Third is the Game:
  
  When the game starts it generates the Board and place the pieces. White will be the first to move a piece
  It checks the game rules if the game is over or not
